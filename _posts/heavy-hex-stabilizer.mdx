### Introduction

The heavy-hexagonal lattice, used in modern quantum processors, may offer **asymmetric protection** against different types of quantum errors. This is due to its unique geometry, which utilizes different-sized error-correcting codes, known as stabilisers.

### The Hardware and Code Layout

The simulation is based on the 27-qubit `FakeMontrealV2` backend, which mimics the heavy-hex topology of a real IBM Falcon r5 processor. The diagram below illustrates the full qubit layout and highlights the three representative stabilisers used in this study: two 3-qubit Z-type vertex stabilisers (`v0_Z`, `v1_Z`) and one 7-qubit X-type face stabiliser (`f0_X`).

### The Method: Stabiliser Measurement Circuits
To detect errors, specific quantum circuits measure a stabiliser's value without disturbing the encoded quantum information. An error is flagged if the measurement outcome is `1`. The circuits below demonstrate this detection mechanism for both a Z-type and an X-type stabiliser, each with a manually inserted error.

#### Z-Type Vertex Stabiliser (`v0_Z`)
This circuit measures the 3-qubit `v0_Z` stabiliser. As shown, the manually inserted `X` error is correctly detected by the ancilla qubit.

#### X-Type Face Stabiliser (`f0_X`)
This more complex circuit measures the 7-qubit `f0_X` stabiliser, correctly detecting the inserted `Z` error.

### Results: Performance Under Noise
To test the central hypothesis, I ran a simulation on the larger X-type face stabiliser (`f0_X`) under two different noise channels: **bit-flip (X) noise** and **phase-flip (Z) noise**. The physical error rate was swept from 0.03% to 3%, and for each point, I measured the "stabiliser failure rate" (the probability of an incorrect measurement).

The plot below shows these results.

#### Interpretation
The results clearly show that the performance of the X-type stabiliser is highly dependent on the noise channel.
* It is **highly sensitive to phase-flip (Z) noise**, with the failure rate rising sharply with the physical error rate. This is expected, as an X-type stabiliser is designed to detect Z-type errors.
* It is **extremely resilient to bit-flip (X) noise**, with a failure rate that remains very low even as the physical error rate increases.

This significant difference between the two curves provides strong initial evidence to support the hypothesis of asymmetric error protection.

### Conclusion
This simulation successfully demonstrates the core mechanics of stabiliser checks and provides preliminary data supporting the central research hypothesis. The clear difference in performance against different noise channels suggests that the geometry of the heavy-hex code could be exploited for hardware with biased noise. The next stage of this research would be to expand this simulation to a fully encoded logical qubit to measure the logical error rate and calculate a precise error threshold.
