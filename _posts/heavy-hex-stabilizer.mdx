### Introduction
This post details a simulation built to explore a potential Honours project. The central hypothesis is that the heavy-hexagonal lattice, used in modern quantum processors, may offer asymmetric protection against different types of quantum errors due to its unique geometry.

### The Hardware: IBM's Falcon Processor

The simulation is based on the 27-qubit `FakeMontrealV2` backend, which mimics the heavy-hex topology of a real IBM Falcon r5 processor. The interactive diagram below shows the qubit connectivity.

### Stabiliser Visuals

We defined and tested three representative stabilisers: two Z-type vertex stabilisers (`v0`, `v1`) and one X-type face stabiliser (`f0`). The following visualizations show the lattice location and the quantum circuit used to check for errors for the `f0` stabiliser.

### Simulation Results

An ideal, noiseless simulation was run to verify the error detection mechanism. The results below show a perfect detection rate: the "With Error" case correctly measures a `1` (error detected), while the "No Error" case correctly measures a `0`.

### Conclusion

This proof-of-concept successfully demonstrates the core mechanics of stabiliser checks on a realistic hardware topology. The next stage of this research involves introducing a noise model to measure the error threshold and quantify the code's performance against different error channels.
